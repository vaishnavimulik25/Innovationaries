# Introduction
Harmony Hands is a web application that empowers users to explore various orphanages and understand their specific needs. Users can view detailed information about these orphanages, including their location, type, and contact details. Moreover, they can extend their support by donating resources or volunteering their time. Together, we can create a community of caring hearts! ðŸ’“


## Installation

pip install npm



## About

Built a dynamic and interactive web application for Harmony Hands using React, JSON, and CSS.
React's component-based architecture allowed us to design and organize the application into reusable and modular components, streamlining the development process.
We used a JSON file to manage the orphanage data, and employed CSS to style the entire application.
The result is a web application that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
